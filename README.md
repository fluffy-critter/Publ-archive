# Publ

Yet another online publishing system.

Not a lot to see here. Also is being developed in tandem with [DreamCatcher](https://github.com/plaidfluff/dreamcatcher.git) so things are going to be wonky for a while.

High-level goals:

* Decentralized social aspects (allow OpenID/OAuth/URL tokens for login)
* Private entries with ACLs (like LJ friend groups or G+ circles)
* Single publishing engine for any sort of content (comics, photos, prose, blogs, etc.)
* Able to maintain separate sections with different themes/templates (incl. navigation schemata)
* All subscription functionality is via RSS feeds (so people can use feed.ly, FeedOnFeeds, etc. as their "dashboard")
* CDN-friendly, HiDPI-capable image rendering/retrieval
* Easy deployment on shared hosting
* Support for multiple authors, using ACLs to grant publish rights to various sections
